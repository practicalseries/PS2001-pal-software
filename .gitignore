# DETAILS
# 
# This is the .gitignore file.
# 
# Its purpose it to tell Git and GitHub which files to ignore when making a
# commit to the repository. Typically these are files created by the operating
# system (.DS_Store on Macs, Thumbs.db on Windows &c.), temporary files,
# automatically generated log files &c.
# 
# With these sorts of files Git would normally flag them as untracked and would
# appear as such following a status command.

# Git uses a .gitignore file to tell it what files should be ignored completely.
# Such files are never mentioned in any status, never added to the staging area,
#  or committed to the repository.
# 
# The .gitignore file should be in the root of the working area of the repository.
# 
# The .gitignore file is a simple text file (note it does not have an extension)
#  that lists the files to ignore. It accepts single and multiple character
# wildcards (? and * respectively). It also accepts comments; anything after
# a # character to the end of the line is treated as a comment.
# 
# The following are example of .gitignore entries:
# 
#              # a comment everything after the # is treated as a comment
# myfile.txt   # ignore the specific file myfile.txt wherever it occurs
# *.log        # all files with a .log extension are ignored
# /myfile.txt  # ignore myfile.txt in the root, but not in any other folder or
#                subfolder
# mywork/      # ignore anything in the mywork folder
# doc/*.txt    # ignore any .txt file in the doc folder, but not in any other
#                folder or subfolder

# IGNORE DEPENDENCY MANAGERS
#              Dependency managers are software modules that coordinate the 
#              integration of external libraries or packages into larger
#              application stack. Dependency managers use configuration files
#              like composer.json, package.json, build.gradle &c
