# PAL &mdash; Case Notes <img height="25px" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CASENOTES.md-2024--05--08-4F81BD.svg">

These case notes are intended as a brief points list of current and upcoming items within the _PAL software development_. In short: notes to myself, a sort of _aide-memoire_ of things I need to do (or at least think about).

It is written in the form of an engineering log book in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top). I know that GitHub provides similar facilities: issues, milestones, actions &c. all of which have their uses. I just wanted something that was a bit more free-flowing and less official. I also wanted something that I could keep in the main repository (on my PC) rather than something that I could only access via GitHub.

This Case Notes file was created on May 8th, 2024.
